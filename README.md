# 2018.Adaboost-CART.predicting-elastic-modulus-recycled-aggregate-concrete
The problem of predicting the modulus of elasticity of recycled aggregate concrete, which is solved in Articles https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.12.030 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.186 by methods ANN, SVR, RBFNN, fuzzy TSK, GP, ABCP, and BBP; is solved in this project by method AdaBoost-CART (based on article https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117000).
Training patterns:320, Testing patterns:80, Toatal patterns: 400,
Selection of test set patterns percentage and random selection of patterns in two sets in a variable form. 
Model 1: Determining the model optimal settings and optimal patterns of each of the two training and test sets, 
Model 2: Determining the best results from the optimal model, No normalization and determining the optimal settings using the trial and error method.
rar files: python software output files and images taken from the Python (Jupyter) in the modeling process.
It is worth mentioning that in order to receive the values of input and target variables and the results of the models of the above-mentioned articles, one should refer to those articles.
